# SRB2Kart

[SRB2Kart](https://srb2.org/mods/) is a kart racing mod based on the 3D Sonic the Hedgehog fangame [Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://srb2.org/), based on a modified version of [Doom Legacy](http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/).

## What's new?
- QoL changes.
- Likely the same as `SRB2-Snowy`, so you can get what is inside of this.
